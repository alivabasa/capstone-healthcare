Problem Statement
•	NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and 
  treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
•	The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, 
  based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
•	Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

Task performed:

1. Data cleaning - removing duplicates, imputing missing values
2. EDA - univariate analysis, bivariate analysis
3. Data preprocessing - standarization of data
4. Model building - KNN, SVM, Random forest, naive bayes and logistic regression
4. Model comparison - metrics used for comparision are, accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC score and PR-AUC score
